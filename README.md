# BLI RoboSail Code

This repository contains the code that we used for our boat. It also includes an instruction guide in the wiki (coming soon) for using this software.
The main site for this project can be found at [robosail.org](http://robosail.org) and the main dependencies with instructions can be found [http://www.robosail.org/student-page.html](here).
